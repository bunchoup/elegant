# The UX Side

## Organism and State Operations connection

Remember MapDispatch to MapStateToProps. Were very famous initial. Further React got famous more external non frontend dev involved without asking why React. Grand Scale involvement demanded faster delivery and thought that MapDispatch to MapStateToProps is slow technique moved forward almost stateless. Such solutions were non maintainable non bulletproof, non scalable just to extact out of the clients. Rather than having an out of box analysis, they skipped steps to earn money. Analsis would have given a realisation that 90% of the code is repetative or prebuilt with CSS Framework. The 10% that you have to work are specific points i.e. Build the organism with CSS framework components and collective API response mapping for reducer that would eventually pass it on to the organism. State Operations have evolved from MapState and MapDispatch to queries and mutations.

## Case Selection

## Identifying Sync and Async Operations


## Adopting CRUD Naming
